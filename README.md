This is a sample program made to allow me to understand all of the string methods in C#, and writing my own Find() and ToHex() function. A set of the string methods are not being used as they are either simple or not needed. Another set of string methods are primarily used while working with other methods and will not have there own button.

Completed String Functions:
Contains, EndsWith, IndexOf, IndexOfAny, Insert, LastIndexOf, LastIndexOfAny, PadLeft, PadRight, Remove, Replace, Split, StartsWith, Substring

Not Doing:
Clone, CompareTo, CopyTo, Equals, GetEnumerator, GetHashType, GetType, GetTypeCode, IsNormalized, Normalize, ToLower, ToLowerInvariant, ToUpper, ToUpperInvariant

Used But No Button:
ToCharArray, Trim (TrimEnd, TrimStart are not used but are understood), ToString

In Development:
Split, Find(), ToHex()
Checking if Negative Int Values exist
